I am a data analyst at Lockheed Martin, where I have been working since May 2023 after completing my MS in Data Science from the University of Denver. I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. I apply these skills to plan, manage, and deliver data-driven solutions and services that support strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

As part of the Workforce Intelligence & Technology unit, I collaborate with teams across various departments to understand their business needs and challenges and to provide them with insights and recommendations based on data analysis and modeling. I use project management methods, data science techniques, and business analytics tools to create and implement data pipelines, dashboards, reports, and visualizations. I also leverage machine learning and deep learning to develop and deploy predictive and prescriptive models that enhance the performance and outcomes of complex systems.

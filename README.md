#### Data Science for Operational Efficiency

At the intersection of data science and operational efficiency, my work focuses on building machine learning models that enhance decision support systems, providing insights, recommendations, and mechanisms to manage data pipelines, analytics, and visualizations. Collaborating with various teams, we design and deliver data-driven solutions that assist the strategic decision-making process.

This is a space where I record relevant courses I have completed and some other work.

Working at the intersection of mathematics, technology, and strategic planning, my work focuses on automation, analytics, algorithms, and statistical modeling to enhance decision support systems. My day-to-day includes providing actionable insights, technical recommendations, and engineering solutions in the business intelligence and data science space. Positioned within Workforce Intelligence, Technical Intelligence, and Competitive Intelligence teams, I support designing and delivering data-driven solutions that assist the strategic decision-making process for organizational cross-functional teams.

This is a space where I record relevant courses I have completed and some other work.

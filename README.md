#### Data Science for Operational Efficiency

My specialization is building machine learning models that enhance decision support systems, providing insights, recommendations, and mechanisms to manage data pipelines, analytics, and visualizations. Collaborating with various teams, we design and deliver data-driven solutions that assist the strategic decision-making process.

This is a space where I record relevant courses I have completed and some other work.

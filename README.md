- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @migh6544
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science & Data Engineering
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Python & R

Currently, I would describe myself as a strategic and methodical professional currently working on STEM academic development, looking for a responsible career opportunity with a reputable organization to utilize my training and skills while contributing to the company's success.

In my past experience, I completed my B.F.A. and M.A., pursuing my passion for the arts and, more specifically, design. This opened the door for me to develop my career with local, regional, and international agencies, serving some of the biggest names in the FMCG, CPG, Pharma, and more. As a result of my exposure to such industries and their fantastic initiatives over the years, I currently hold over 12 years of professional experience in account and project management roles. Some of the initiatives I worked with on the agency and client sides include architecture and design, marketing and public relations, energy and natural science, brand and business development, and consumer goods, to name a few.

In recent years, I have started transforming my career towards data science and data engineering. Accordingly, I am currently working on phase one of my academic development by pursuing my second undergraduate degree (BS), majoring in statistics and data science while minoring in mathematics, computer science, and business. I am also planning the second phase of my academic development by preparing for my second graduate degree (MS) in computer science (Data Science & Data Engineering) and my third graduate degree (MBA) in engineering management. I also aim to continue developing my knowledge as I advance my professional career on the job.

I am currently seeking the right career opportunity with a reputable organization where I can utilize my training and skills while making significant contributions to the company's success. Accordingly, I am always excited to find a mutual fit where I can support the team, the business and encourage the company's overall growth.
